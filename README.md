# Frontend Mentor - FAQ Accordion Card

![Design preview for the FAQ Accordion Card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Instructions

See [original readme](./ORIGINAL_README.md) for details about challenge.

## Initial Thoughts

The design seems pretty straightforward. This time there are some clear differences for mobile and desktop design. They should be pretty easy to handle with flexbox. I have a vague memory of how to implement accordion behavior with CSS, but that will be interesting to figure out.

## Approach

I'm going to try something different from the [profile card component](https://github.com/michaelyuen/profile-card-component) solution. This time I'll do everything in the single index.html file and I'll implement as much as possible with inline html and css. Quick and dirty, why not!

Already realizing that to do _everything_ as inline as possible is totally asking for trouble. Starting out and trying to update the attribution styles, it is **obvious** that adding a simple class name makes things so much easier. So to revise my previous statement, I'll do things as quick and easy as possible, but to force everything to be inline is just masochistic.
